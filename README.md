# Welcome to The BDK-RN Expo POC app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) (*when using a Mac*)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## The goal/motivation

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the integration of the BDK-RN library in an Expo project for the purpose of rapid bitcoin application development in the react native ecosystem. The BDK-RN library is a React Native library that provides a set of utilities to interact with the BDK (Bitcoin Development Kit). The BDK is a simple way to integrate Bitcoin wallet features into your application.
